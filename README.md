# angular-eat
Enhanced Angular Tools, a set of directives intended to help and speed up the work on forms in an angular app.

Todo:
- add examples
- write a proper readme.md
- add some grunt tasks (less, injector, minify, watch)
- write unit test (chai, mocha, sinon)
- write e2e test (protractor)
- create bower package (upload to bower... how?)
- add eat-group-required if input is required
